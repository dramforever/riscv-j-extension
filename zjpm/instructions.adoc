== ISA Extensions

This section describes the pointer masking extensions `Smmpm`, `Smnpm` and `Ssnpm`. All of these extensions are privileged ISA extensions and do not add any new CSRs. For the definitions of `Sspm` and `Supm`, see <<_pointer_masking_extensions>>.

[NOTE]
====
Future extensions may introduce additional CSRs to allow different privilege modes to modify their own pointer masking settings. This may be required for future use cases in managed runtime systems that are not currently addressed as part of this extension.
====

Each extension introduces a 2-bit WARL field (`PMM`) that may take on the following values to set the pointer masking settings for a particular privilege mode.

[%header, cols="25%,75%", options="header"]
.Possible values of `PMM` WARL field.
|===
|Value|Description
|00|Pointer masking is disabled (PMLEN=0)
|01|Reserved
|10|Pointer masking is enabled with PMLEN=XLEN-57 (PMLEN=7 on RV64)
|11|Pointer masking is enabled with PMLEN=XLEN-48 (PMLEN=16 on RV64)
|===

All of these fields are read-only 0 on RV32 systems.

=== Ssnpm

`Ssnpm` adds a new 2-bit WARL field (`PMM`) to bits 33:32 of `senvcfg`. Setting `PMM` enables or disables pointer masking for the next lower privilege mode (U/VU mode), according to the values in Table 2.

In systems where the H Extension is present, `Ssnpm` also adds a new 2-bit WARL field (`PMM`) to bits 33:32 of `henvcfg`. Setting `PMM` enables or disables pointer masking for VS-mode, according to the values in Table 2.

=== Smnpm

`Smnpm` adds a new 2-bit WARL field (`PMM`) to bits 33:32 of `menvcfg`. Setting `PMM` enables or disables pointer masking for the next lower privilege mode (S-/HS-mode if S-mode is implemented, or U-mode otherwise), according to the values in Table 2.

[NOTE]
====
The type of address determines which type of pointer masking is applied. For example, when running with virtualization in VS/VU mode with `vsatp.MODE` = Bare, physical address pointer masking (zero extension) applies.
====

=== Smmpm

`Smmpm` adds a new 2-bit WARL field (`PMM`) to bits 33:32 of `mseccfg`. The presence of `Smmpm` implies the presence of the `mseccfg` register, even if it would not otherwise be present. Setting `PMM` enables or disables pointer masking for M mode, according to the values in Table 2.

=== Interaction with SFENCE.VMA

Since pointer masking applies to the effective address only and does not affect any memory-management data structures, no SFENCE.VMA is required after enabling/disabling pointer masking.

=== Interaction with Two-Stage Address Translation

Guest physical addresses (GPAs) are 2 bits wider than the corresponding virtual address translation modes, resulting in additional address translation schemes Sv32x4, Sv39x4, Sv48x4 and Sv57x4 for translating guest physical addresses to supervisor physical addresses. When running with virtualization in VS/VU mode with `vsatp.MODE` = Bare, this means that those two bits may be subject to pointer masking, depending on `hgatp.MODE` and `henvcfg.PMM`. If `vsatp.MODE` != BARE, this issue does *not* apply.

[NOTE]
====
An implementation could mask those two bits on the TLB access path, but this can have a significant timing impact. Alternatively, an implementation may choose to "waste" TLB capacity by having up to 4 duplicate entries for each page. In this case, the pointer masking operation can be applied on the TLB refill path, where it is unlikely to affect timing. To support this approach, some TLB entries need to be flushed when PMLEN changes in a way that may affect these duplicate entries.
====

To support implementations where (XLEN-PMLEN) can be less than the GPA width supported by `hgatp.MODE`, hypervisors should execute an `HFENCE.GVMA` with rs1=x0 if the `henvcfg.PMM` is changed from or to a value where (XLEN-PMLEN) is less than GPA width supported by the `hgatp` translation mode of that guest. Specifically, these cases are:

* `PMLEN=7` and `hgatp.MODE=sv57x4`
* `PMLEN=16` and `hgatp.MODE=sv57x4`
* `PMLEN=16` and `hgatp.MODE=sv48x4`

[NOTE]
====
`Smmpm` implementations need to satisfy max(largest supported virtual address size, largest supported supervisor physical address size) <= (XLEN - PMLEN) bits to avoid any masking logic on the TLB access path.
====

Implementation of an address-specific `HFENCE.GVMA` should either ignore the address argument, or should ignore the top masked GPA bits of entries when comparing for an address match.

=== Number of Masked Bits

As described in <<_determining_the_value_of_pmlen>>, the supported values of PMLEN may depend on the effective privilege mode. The current standard only defines PMLEN=XLEN-48 and PMLEN=XLEN-57, but this assumption may be relaxed in future extensions and profiles. Trying to enable pointer masking in an unsupported scenario represents an illegal write to the corresponding pointer masking enable bit and follows WARL semantics. Future profiles may choose to define certain combinations of privilege modes and supported values of PMLEN as mandatory.

[NOTE]
====
An option that was considered but discarded was to allow implementations to set PMLEN depending on the active addressing mode. For example, PMLEN could be set to 16 for Sv48 and to 25 for Sv39. However, having a single value of PMLEN (e.g., setting PMLEN to 16 for both Sv39 and Sv48 rather than 25) facilitates TLB implementations in designs that support Sv39 and Sv48 but not Sv57. 16 bits are sufficient for current pointer masking use cases but allow for a TLB implementation that matches against the same number of virtual tag bits independently of whether it is running with Sv39 or Sv48. However, if Sv57 is supported, tag matching may need to be conditional on the current address translation mode.
